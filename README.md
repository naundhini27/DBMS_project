# Student Database Management System
Careful planning is essential to manage educational institutions these days as they have evolved into complex entities with multiple campuses, many departments, different sections, and a large number of students.
The Student Database Management System allows users to set up reminders for the different events and activities that are needed to be organized by the school’s administration department. 
It also enables school authorities to share relevant information with students and teachers.
