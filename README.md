# Student Database Management System
Careful planning is essential to manage educational institutions these days as they have evolved into complex entities with multiple campuses, many departments, different sections, and a large number of students.
The Student Database Management System allows users to set up reminders for the different events and activities that are needed to be organized by the schoolâ€™s administration department. 
It also enables school authorities to share relevant information with students and teachers.
